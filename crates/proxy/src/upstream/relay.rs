//! `docs/proxy-behavior.md` §9 — the Messages relay.
//!
//! The second provider speaks the surface this proxy already exposes, so a
//! turn belonging to it is forwarded rather than translated. Nothing here
//! parses, maps, or re-encodes the payload: the bytes the client sent are the
//! bytes the backend receives, and the bytes it answers with are the bytes the
//! client reads.
//!
//! That is a rule rather than an observation. Translation would round-trip the
//! body through this proxy's own types, and every field they do not model —
//! today's and next release's — would be dropped somewhere no test looks. The
//! only thing that changes on the way is the header set, which §9.2 states
//! exactly.
