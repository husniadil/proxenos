//! Capturing the real Messages surface as conformance fixtures.
//!
//! This proxy's product is an Anthropic Messages surface, and until this module
//! existed nothing here had ever seen one. The corpus is built from the
//! upstream provider's protocol definitions and from captures of the *client*
//! side, so every conformance claim — the SSE event vocabulary, the error
//! envelope, the sizing response — was derived from documentation rather than
//! measured against the endpoint the client thinks it is talking to.
//!
//! Neither existing capture mode answers it. `record upstream` is wired into
//! the translating path, where the events are the other provider's; a relayed
//! turn (§9) streams back untouched with nothing recording it. So this is a
//! third mode, and unlike the other two it makes the calls itself rather than
//! waiting for a client to make them: what is wanted is a handful of known
//! shapes, not whatever a session happens to send.
//!
//! It goes out through `Relay`, the same code that carries a relayed turn, so
//! what is captured is what the shipping path would receive. It spends quota —
//! one exchange per plan, and the list is deliberately short.
//!
//! **A capture is written to disk and committed.** The credential that fetched
//! it is supplied by this proxy, so the response header set is its own doing;
//! it is scrubbed by name before anything is serialized.
