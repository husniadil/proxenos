//! `docs/proxy-behavior.md` §3.2 — per-conversation state.
//!
//! Claude Code sends no session identifier, so identity is derived from
//! content: a request belongs to an existing session when its input is a strict
//! extension of that session's baseline (§3.1). The same predicate governs
//! incremental upload, so matching and delta computation cannot disagree.
