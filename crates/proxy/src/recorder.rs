//! Capturing exchanges as fixtures.
//!
//! Two modes, and the distinction matters because only one of them costs
//! anything. Ingress capture records what the client sends, before translation,
//! and needs no credentials at all. Upstream capture records what the backend
//! sends back, and spends quota.
//!
//! Empty-stream capture is neither: it is always on, because §5.4 says an empty
//! stream is always a defect and is otherwise invisible.
//!
//! **A capture is conversation content.** It holds the system prompt, the
//! messages, and whatever the tools read — file contents included. It is not a
//! credential, but it is not public either, so captures are written to the
//! per-user configuration directory rather than a shared temporary one, created
//! `0600`, and bounded so a repeating failure cannot fill a disk.
