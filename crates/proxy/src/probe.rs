//! `docs/proxy-behavior.md` §10.3 — capability probes.

//! A probe must turn on content the model could not infer. A model handed no
//! file at all describes one confidently from its name, and that output is
//! indistinguishable from success — so every probe here checks for a random
//! code that exists nowhere except in the exchange under test.
//!
//! **What these prove.** Run against replayed fixtures they establish that the
//! proxy does its half: that the bytes reach the upstream request in the shape
//! the backend expects, and that what the backend said reaches the client
//! intact. They do not establish that the backend does its half. That needs a
