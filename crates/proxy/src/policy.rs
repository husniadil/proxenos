//! `docs/api.md` §3 — the parts of the configuration a running daemon can change.
//!
//! The tier mapping and the effort ceiling were read once at startup and copied
//! into two places: the control socket answered `status` and `env` from one, the
//! ingress routed turns with the other. Nothing could change either without a
//! restart, and nothing needed to.
//!
//! A front-end changes that. Setting a mapping over the socket has to move the
//! copy that *routes turns*, or the daemon would report one mapping and serve
//! another — a divergence that produces working turns against the wrong model,
//! which is the failure this project refuses everywhere else. `tiers.set`,
//! `effort.set`, `accounts.select` and `config.reload` all arrive here, and
//! they are the whole set: everything else in the configuration is read once
//! and needs a restart.
//!
//! **The file stays the source of truth at startup.** A runtime change is
//! written back to it where the caller asks for that, and where it is not, the
//! change lasts until the daemon stops. Both are stated to the caller rather
//! than left to be discovered.
//!
//! **A turn in flight keeps the mapping it started with.** Readers take a
//! snapshot, so a set that lands mid-turn cannot change the model a request is
//! already being translated for. A client that was handed
//! `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` at spawn keeps asking for that id until it is
//! restarted, which is the same lifetime the ids always had.
