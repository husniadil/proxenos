//! `docs/api.md` §2.6 — the supervisor unit.
//!
//! Everything the unit *is* — the platform decision, the socket path, the
//! rendering — is a pure function over data named here rather than read from
//! the process, so a plist that would supervise nothing is refused in a test
//! rather than discovered by an operator whose daemon never came back.
//!
//! Installing and removing it is the only part that touches the machine, and
//! that lives with the rest of the I/O.
