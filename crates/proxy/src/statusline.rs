//! `docs/api.md` §2.1 — filling in a status line's quota.
//!
//! The status line is whatever script the user configured, and it is handed a
//! JSON payload on stdin. That payload has no quota in it when the client is
//! pointed at a proxy: the client tracks a subscription quota for its own
//! account, and a proxy is not one. Measured — setting the response headers it
//! parses is not enough.
//!
//! So the data is put where the script already looks. This wraps the user's own
//! command: read their payload, merge in what the backend reported, hand it on.
//! A script written against the client's shape keeps working and gains a figure
//! it could not otherwise have.
//!
//! **Merging never invents.** A window the backend did not report leaves the
//! field absent rather than zero, and a window whose length matches neither of
//! the two the client names is not filed under either — it is reported under a
//! key of our own, where its real length travels with it.

/// nothing would paint one account's quota over another's — wrong in the
/// direction that reads as headroom.

/// daemon serves, and a payload naming something else belongs to a session this
/// daemon knows nothing about. **An unanswerable question merges.** A snapshot
/// that names no models or a payload that names none leaves nothing to compare,
