//! `docs/proxy-behavior.md` §8 — turning a stored credential into headers.
//!
//! Two kinds of credential reach two different endpoints, and the difference
//! between them is a header set. Resolving that in one place is what keeps a
//! subscription header off a key request: every path that authenticates asks
//! here rather than assembling its own.
